;14 shellcodes to be xored, we can also use loop. 112 bytes

;extracted shellcode, placed in reverse order (SWITCHED TOP W BOTTOM, to retrieve correct shellcode)

;Reversed Order of the Content (In the Challenge, running given Shellcode is enough)
;but in reality, when pushing, the last to go in, is the first to go out.
;meaning u switch positions, when pushing a string , the Order of the Positions get switched, last to first
;first to last, with this keep in mind, that if this was a real challenge.
;the presented block below would be the correct shellcode

;u can always rearange the contents, if u dont know the arragment.
;First becomes last, and positions swap, u should get the arragement pretty easily, smile.
