# LowLevelChallenges

## Overview
This solution involves a combination of Python and assembly files. I wrote both the code and the files myself to solve a challenge. The purpose of this file is to share the solution with others who might be interested in reviewing it.

## Code Description
The solution includes:
- **Assembly files**: The main logic is implemented in assembly, which generates shellcode.
- **Python scripts**: These scripts are responsible for:
  - Extracting shellcode from the assembly files.
  - Executing the shellcode.
  - Verifying that the shellcode does not contain null bytes, which is a critical step in ensuring the shellcode's functionality.

The Python code acts as a toolset to manipulate and validate the shellcode generated by the assembly.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the files.
2. Compile the assembly code if necessary to generate the shellcode.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to:
   - Extract the shellcode from the assembly files.
   - Execute the shellcode for testing.
   - Verify that the shellcode does not contain any null bytes.

## Challenges

1. **AcademyChall.asm Decryption**:  
   The `AcademyChall.asm` was originally an executable, which I disassembled using `objdump` with Intel syntax. The challenge specified that the key for decrypting stack values is stored in the `RBX` register.  
   I added custom code to decrypt the values and extract shellcode from the stack. The shellcode is formatted as a string, which can be inserted into the `!Shellcoding.py` script (as the second argument) to execute it on a Linux environment and retrieve the flag.  
   *(Ensure you're using an x64 CPU)*

2. **Shellcode Execution**:  
   The other assembly files are shellcode executables written by myself. Extract the shellcode using `!ExtractShell.py`, then execute it with `!Shellcoding.py` to either spawn a shell or retrieve the contents of a specific file.  
   The `GetFile.asm` instructions must be modified to specify the target file.

I will continue updating this repository with new challenges and eventually publish my own exploits, including buffer and stack overflows, targeting specific vulnerabilities. These will be shared strictly for educational purposes.
